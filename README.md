**_Read the full article on the development of this smart guide in [this link of Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/developing-an-ai-powered-smart-guide-for-business-planning-entrepreneurship-ea1bc328ff01/)_**.

### Overview

The **Smart Business Guide 1.0** is an AI-powered solution for entrepreneurship and business planning in Finland, built on advanced **Agentic RAG** using LangChain and LangGraph frameworks. It uses advanced retrieval-augmented generation workflows to provide precise responses to user queries.

**Update:** The current version of _app.py_ is using "_agentic_rag.py_" which does not uses web scraping tools. To use the version of the web scraping tools, replace:

```
from agentic_rag import initialize_app
```

with

```
from agentic_rag_with_tools import initialize_app
```

---

in _app.py_.

### Key Features

- **Authentic Information Retrieval**: Retrieves information from authentic business and entrepreneurship guides parsed using LlamaParse.

- **Dynamic Workflow Decisions**: Determines whether to use vector databases, web searches, or specialized tools based on query requirements, ensuring trusted and relevant results.

- **Retrieval Grading Mechanism**: Evaluates the relevancy of retrieved documents, deciding whether to proceed with the data or invoke a web search for additional information.

- **Answer Style Customization**: Provides flexibility to choose from three response styles:

  - **Concise**: Focused and brief answers.
  - **Moderate**: Balanced with some explanation.
  - **Explanatory**: Detailed with examples and illustrations.

- **Flexible Search Options**

  - Internet-only search.
  - Hybrid search combining vector database results with internet queries.

- **Model Selection Flexibility**: Offers the ability to select:
  - Open-source models accessed via Groq Cloud API for lightning-fast responses.
  - OpenAI models for enhanced capabilities.
    Different LLMs can be assigned to specific nodes within the agentic workflow for tailored performance.

### How It Works

The Smart Guide integrates agentic AI workflows to dynamically:

1. Parse and retrieve data from pre-indexed guides.
2. Assess retrieved content for relevance.
3. Choose the most appropriate method (vector database, web search, or tools) to address the query.
4. Provide tailored responses based on user-selected answer styles.

# How to Use the Code.

**Clone the repository:**

```
git clone https://github.com/umairalipathan1980/Smart-Business-Guide-1.0.git
cd Smart-Business-Guide-1.0
```

**Install the required libraries:**

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Create a folder ".streamlit" in the root directory and create a "secrets.toml" file in it. Set your API keys there as follows:**

```
GROQ_API_KEY = "your_GROQ_api_key" # get a free Groq API key from Groq Cloud
TAVILY_API_KEY = "your_Tavily_api_key" # get a free Tavily API key
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY = "your_LangChain_API_key" # get a free API key from LangSmith
OPENAI_API_KEY = "your_OpenAI_API_KEY" # (optional) for OpenAI models
```

**For running the code locally, comment the following lines. These lines were added to run the code on Streamlit**

```
__import__('pysqlite3')
import sys
sys.modules['sqlite3'] = sys.modules.pop('pysqlite3')
```

**Run the main application**

```
streamlit run app.py
```

or

```
python -m streamlit run app.py
```
